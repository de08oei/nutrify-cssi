  Mission & Vision
</h2>

<p>
  
  Nutrify's mission is to promote a healthy and balanced diet through providing
  the fridge management software we all need to make meal decisions easy as pie
  (or cake, or if you want something savory, tons of awesome choices there too)!

  Our vision is simple. We want to provide all users with a seamless shopping
  and home-dining experience by removing all the hard work surrounding meal prep.
  Simply let us know what you're craving, and we will help match you with the 
  perfect recipes and meal plans to keep you healthy and happy!
